# Corpus to Reading Level

Transforms all the documents in the corpus by removing all the 'English' stopwords.
The list used is NLTK's default.

## Run the script

You may need to get the stopwords as NLTK may not download it automatically.

```{shell}
python.exe -c "import nltk;nltk.download('stopwords')"
```

The script is run in accordance with the [general form](../README.md#scripts)
